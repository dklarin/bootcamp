#### Welcome to the Lemon Mint bootcamp for junior front-end developers.

The goal of this course is to teach you basic and advanced programming topics so that you gain skills necessary to be productive on projects Lemon Mint is developing. This course is tailored for front end development positions, meaning you will be dealing mainly with javaScript, HTML/CSS and ReactJs framework. We expect attendees to have some previous programming knowledge, but it's not required to have any javaScript/frontend programming experience. We will start with the very basic javaScript stuff.

### Curriculum

0. course intro (you are here now)
1. [JavaScript basics](/posts/1_js_basic)
1. ES5/ES6 and beyond
1. HTML/CSS basics
1. The ReactJs framework intro.
1. _Let's build something TBA_

### To truly know and understand

Please don't expect that you will gain complete knowledge only by attending this lectures. Our main goal is to understand the principles and techniques required to become a productive programmer, we don't need to overwhelm our heads with every possible detail. We have google/stackoverflow for that. But we need to understand what's going on behind the scenes and truly "know" how the code we wrote will be executed by the environment that we target.
But, to be productive it's not enough to understand. You will need to upload into your head as many as possible tips, tricks, methods and techniques. For that it is essential that you write code, and then write some more code.... It's super useful to read other programmers code, you can learn a lot that way also.

##### Every programmer starts as a "cargo-cultists"

From Eric Lippert's [blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ericlippert/2004/03/01/syntax-semantics-micronesian-cults-and-novice-programmers/) you may find this inspiring

> _During the Second World War, the Americans set up airstrips on various tiny islands in the Pacific. After the war was over and the Americans went home, the natives did a perfectly sensible thing -- they dressed themselves up as ground traffic controllers and waved those sticks around. They mistook cause and effect -- they assumed that the guys waving the sticks were the ones making the planes full of supplies appear, and that if only they could get it right, they could pull the same trick. From our perspective, we know that it's the other way around -- the guys with the sticks are there because the planes need them to land. No planes, no guys._

> _The cargo cultists had the unimportant surface elements right, but did not see enough of the whole picture to succeed. **They understood the form but not the content.** There are lots of cargo cult programmers -- **programmers who understand what the code does, but not how it does it.** Therefore, they cannot make meaningful changes to the program. They tend to proceed by making random changes, testing, and changing again until they manage to come up with something that works._

We strive not to be a cargo cultist! Please if you are not 100% sure you understand the topic, yell and say so! We will never move forward until everyone is tuned in with the topic.
