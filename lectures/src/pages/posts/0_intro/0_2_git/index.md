_"Git is a [free and open source](https://git-scm.com/) distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency."_

Created by Linus Torvalds (also the developer of Linux kernel)

##Git ?
The result of a programmer is a program code, and that is nothing more than a bunch of text files. To be efficient in our jobs we need a way to track the changes we make in the source code files and distribute our work to other team members. We sometimes need to revert the changes we made, incorporate the changes other team members made, and so on...
All of that and much more is a job of a version control system, and today Git is a de facto standard and the most popular version control system.
<info-banner text='GitHub should not be confused with git. GitHub is a cloud provider of Git repositories (one of many, but here we like GitHub best). At this point you should already have a working GitHub account.'/>

Mastering Git is an **important skill** for every programmer. For now only the basic stuff will suffice.
