> _JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles._

The definition above is taken from the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) (highly recommended reference guide for web developers).
We can see many many "big" words here, not all, if any, meaningful to you now. At the end of the bootcamp we will come back to this definition and discuss whether the definition is any more clear than it is now. It should be I hope :)

For now we can simply say that javaScript is simple but powerful programming language that can be used to create interactive web applications that run in the browser. It is also used in other [non-browser environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Uses_outside_Web_pages) (e.g. server backend services).
